\usage{
actual_360(date1, date2)
}
\arguments{
\item{date1}{A date-time object}

\item{date2}{A date-time object}
}

a numeric value representing the number of years between
\code{date1} and \code{date2}.
}
\description{
This calculates the years between two dates using the actual/360 day basis
convention. This convention counts the number of calendars beween the start
and end dates and assumes a year consists of 360 days. This is also known
as the A/360, Act/360 or French day basis convention.
}
\details{
The year fraction is calculated as:
\deqn{\frac{Number of calendar days}{360}}

The order of \code{date1} and \code{date2} is not important. If \code{date1}
is less than \code{date2} then the result will be non-negative. Otherwise,
the result will be negative.
