  the economic nature of financial market contracts that are typically defined
  by International Swap Dealer Association (ISDA, <http://www2.isda.org>) legal
  documentation. This includes methods to check whether dates are business
  days in certain locales, functions to adjust and shift dates and time length
  (or day counter) calculations.
